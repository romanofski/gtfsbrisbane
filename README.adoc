Be on time for your next public transport service.

What time do I need to leave the office to minimize waiting time for my train?
____

The command is intended to be invoked frequently in a status bar (such as
https://github.com/jaor/xmobar[xmobar]) showing next departing services for one
particular stop.

The command shows remaining minutes in order to leave the current spot
(e.g. office) to minimize the waiting time at the bus or train stop.

[[installation]]
Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[from-source]]
From source
^^^^^^^^^^^

Haskell provides a tool called
https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/[stack] which can be installed on
many systems.

Using `stack` you can compile and install:

----
stack install
----

in your local folder (`~/.local`). Make sure it is in your `$PATH`.

[[packages]]
Packages
^^^^^^^^

Experimental packages are available for Fedora 24 via
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/romanofski/gtfsschedule/[copr].

~~~~~

[[preparing-the-data]]
Preparing the data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run the setup command like:

----
gtfsschedule setup --static-url https://gtfsrt.api.translink.com.au/GTFS/SEQ_GTFS.zip
----

The database is created by default in: `$HOME/.local/share/gtfs/`

[[invoking-the-command]]
Invoking the command
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Find out which stop code it is you need to monitor from your service
provider.

As an example this is Brisbane's Roma St, platform 8 stop code:
https://jp.translink.com.au/plan-your-journey/stops/600029[600029].

Once you have your stop code, invoke the command to show next departing
services:

[source, bash]
----
# Transport leaves in 11 minutes
gtfsschedule monitor 600248
Desitnation 11 min (13:17:00)
----

[[using-a-count-down]]
Using a count down
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to know when to leave your position in order to reach the
service upon departure time, you can specify a delay:

[source, bash]
----
# Transport leaves in 11 minutes, factor in a walk time to the stop/station of 7 minutes
gtfsschedule monitor 600248+7

# Include in realtime updates with possible delays
gtfsschedule monitor 600248+7 --realtime-url http://gtfsrt.api.translink.com.au/Feed/SEQ
----

[[monitoring-multiple-stops]]
Monitoring multiple stops
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can specify multiple stops with different delays to reach them:

```bash
gtfsschedule monitor 600248+7 600249+5
```

[[schedule-change-indicators-format]]
Schedule change indicators format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you run the program with realtime updates, the following changes
are indicated as follows:

[source, bash]
----
# Delayed service
!GTPB Destination 11 min (13:17:06 (46s)) <-- delay
                          ^ departure time including delay

# Canceled service
GTPB Destination 11 min (13:17:00 !CANC!)
----

[[updating-the-database]]
Updating the database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you run the gtfsschedule tool with the `static-url` option, it
automatically checks if the local dataset is up to date and prints a
warning if it isn't. Simply run:

----
gtfsschedule setup --static-url https://gtfsrt.api.translink.com.au/GTFS/SEQ_GTFS.zip
----

to update download a new dataset and update your database.

[[automatically-keeping-the-database-up-to-date]]
Automatically keeping the database up-to-date
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can invoke `gtfsschedule monitor` with `-u` to keep your static
dataset up-to-date:

----
gtfsschedule monitor -u --static-url https://gtfsrt.api.translink.com.au/GTFS/SEQ_GTFS.zip 600029
----

[[configuration-file]]
Configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A configuration file helps with making the use of the command line tool easier,
especially if you're always receiving updates from the same API and the dataset
from the same URL. The command line options and arguments have precedence over
the configuration file however.

The configuration file should be placed in `~/.conf/gtfs/config.cfg`
and supports setting the URLs to the realtime API and the static dataset.
For example, for Brisbane the config file would look:

[source, ini]
----
[default]
static-url = https://gtfsrt.api.translink.com.au/GTFS/SEQ_GTFS.zip
realtime-url = http://gtfsrt.api.translink.com.au/Feed/SEQ
----

The format of the configuration file is documented here:
https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ini/docs/Data-Ini.html

Note: I have not tested how well the support works with other GTFS feed APIs
than Translink (QR) provides. Feedback is very welcome.

Config examples for status monitors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Xmobar:

----
Run Com "gtfsschedule" ["monitor", "600248"] "gtfs" 600
----

Poor mans statusbar with `watch`. Use a terminal window and:

----
watch -n 60 "gtfsschedule monitor 600248+7"
----
