= GTFS-Schedule
:doctype: book

Be on time for your next public transport service.

== Motivation

____
What time do I need to leave the office to minimize waiting time for my train?
____

The command is intended to be invoked frequently in a status bar (such as
https://github.com/jaor/xmobar[xmobar]) showing next departing services for one
particular stop.

The command shows remaining minutes in order to leave the current spot
(e.g. office) to minimize the waiting time at the bus or train stop.

== Non Goals

* a route planner

== Installation

=== From source

Haskell provides a tool called
https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/[stack] which can be installed on
many systems.

Using `stack` you can compile and install:

----
stack install

in your local folder (`~/.local`). Make sure it is in your `$PATH`.

=== Packages

Experimental packages are available for Fedora 24 via
